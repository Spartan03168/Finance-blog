Notes:
    - Up next is model linking and CRUD
    - Right after that set up the email service to send an update to my personal email.

Dev notes
- Routing is a mess so the blog page is unreachable. I cant test the crud even if I get to be there in the code.
- I am just going to finish out this list untested as much as possible up to my 15:00 which is your 09:00.
- No idea what I will get, but mentally I already accepted failure.
